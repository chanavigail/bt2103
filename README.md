# Analysis of Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset

<p> 
  A report analysing the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset. 
  We built many models in R to predict which clients would default on their credit card payments. 
  These models include lm, glm, SVM, classification tree, random forest and neural network.  
</p>

<p> 
  The dataset is obtained from the UCI repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients.
  It contains payment information of 30,000 credit card holders obtained from a bank in Taiwan. 
  Each data sample is described by 23 feature attributes (columns B to X). 
  The target feature (column Y) to be predicted is binary valued 0 (= not default) or 1 (= default).
